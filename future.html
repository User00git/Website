                <h2>Future Direction</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon completion of my degree at university, I am looking forward to heading into the real world field for cybersecurity. I intend to apply the 
                    experiences and knowledge gained to help protect data and infrastructures. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope to work for either established cybersecurity firms or nascent startups. I am equally captivated to work as I want to provide a foundation 
                    of stability in the environment. My primary aim in working in these fields is to enhance the security protocols of major corporations or aid in the 
                    development of emerging cybersecurity enterprises. Anticipating and counteracting evolving digital threats are also on my bucketlist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An intrest that really sparks me is the synergy between cybersecurity and arificial-intelligence (AI) acknowlodgign the potential for these and mitigating
                    these threats would be very compelling to me. The path to work in the computing industry is interesting as it is an ever-shifting domain, however, as 
                    recent trends have shown, it is harder than ever to get a tech role. Hopefully all goes well.
