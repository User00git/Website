                <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
                    <p>
                        My journey to the world of computing began since I was a jit. I had my sights set on <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">UTS</a> for university, 
                        which led me to undertake the HSC with great dedication.
                        
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Post highschool, I worked for a contract work for an AI Data-Trainer for a couple months which is my first real experience in computing.
                        I am also a self-employed graphic designer by creating album artwork/tracklists and also engineering and mixing raw vocals from artists. 
                        To pass time I would learn how to program and code to become proficient in Java and Python so oneday I can do cybersecurity things which are pretty awesome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, as a second-year student, I continue to reflect on my past experiences, drawing from them the strength and determination that fuel my 
                        academic and hopefully professional pursuits :D.
                    </p>
