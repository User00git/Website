                    <p>
                        Designing this website has been a journey involving the blend of my creative skills alongside my technical expertise. I aimed to deliver
                        a website that visually pushed the boundaries of the criteria with a unique outlook and captured the users' attention from the moment they
                        open the page. Throughout the creation of this website, I have developed a greater understanding of the complexities and intricases within
                        web design from creating a functional layout to incorporating small features that improve the user interface. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Balancing aesthetics with functionality provided its challenge as the website was made to have a strict container within the body. I had to ensure the
                        site was able to allow the user to function within the restrictive space and look appealing on a multitude of devices and web-browsers.
                        The project showcases the merging of creativity and technological expertise in the digital realm.

                    <h4>Structure of Website</h4>
                    <p>
                        The architecture of the website is structured using HTML and CSS standards, this ensures the semantic markup and compatibility across modern devices and 
                        web-browsers. The table below details the layout of the website:
                    </p>
                        <table>
                            <thead>

                    <h4>Webpage Structure</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><b>Header:</b></span> Includes the title of the website. The header is designed to be attention-grabbing and convey the 
                            website's purpose to the user immediately.</li>
                        
                            <p></p>

                        <li><span><b>Body:</b></span> The main content area where the page's primary information is displayed. This HTML code represents the main content section of a webpage. 
                            Within the <i>'main'</i> element, there is a <i>'div'</i> with the class "container" to help structure the content. Inside this container, there are several paragraphs 
                            (<i>`p`</i>) containing information about the author of the website. This section varies from page to page to present the relevant content.</li>

                            <p></p>
                            <p>The CSS code provided creates style rules for various parts of a webpage. It targets containers, tables, and the main content space. 
                                Two classes are used to format container elements - ".container" and ".containerr". These two classes have similar rules about maximum width, 
                                centering with auto margins, padding and spacing using margins. They have different maximum width values, giving flexibility in design.
                                ⁤⁤Table elements are made for improving readability and visual appeal.</p>
                            <p></p>

                        <li><span><b>Footer:</b></span> Includes copyright information and the navigation menu "home", "past", "future", "comments" here for accessibility. 
                            It remains consistent throughout the site for familiarity. Within CSS, the navigation is put into a <i>'ul'</i> tag and the entire list 
                            carries the user to the respective page. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
                    <p>
                        The user interface is crafted with a focus on the minimalistic design principles one that mimcs a professional high-end website, 
                        it favors a clean and uncluttered user experience that prioritises content readability and ease of navigation.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Colour Theory</h4>
                    <p>
                        The colour scheme predominately utilises a white background, with black text. The use of white serves as a neutral backdrop that enhances readability
                        and creates a sense of sleek and simplicity to the user. The red logo and backdrop when hovering over the navigation bar helps keep the user entertained
                        as red is a strong colour and complements white very well. It also helps draw attention to important elements such as titles and tables. The hue of red and white
                        is vibrant to purposely maintain the user's engagement. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To avoid overwhelming the reader, red is only used in important aspects and two lighter hues are added for the design of the tables. Together, 
                        the combination of red and white in the color scheme achieves a balance between urgency and clarity.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Font</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the webpage's font, there is a uniform and clear style. The main text uses 'Courier New', which is a monospaced typeface that offers easy-to-read lines. 
                        This size of 12px for the text ensures content can be seen without being too big or small on screen. On the other hand, 
                        headers are styled in a way to make them very noticeable. The header's h1 element has a size of 28px which makes appear bold and big. 
                        Different font types and styles like Arial in boxed-header class and Courier New for h3 further create an interesting 
                        visual effect yet still easy to read style.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
                    <p>
                        The header is in the middle, a unique design for the interface, this makes it more noticeable and gives a place for main title to become focus point of page. 
                         Also, the footer has navigation links so users can effortlessly visit various parts of the website. 
                         These links show hover effects which give visual response when a user's mouse pointer is on them. 
                         This adds to the interactive experience and makes it easy for users to navigate through different sections of this webpage or site in general.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Structure</h4>
                    <p>
                        The body uses flexbox layout which helps in aligning content correctly and adjusting it to various screen sizes for a responsive design. 
                        The main area for content is put in a 'container'; it shows at center and has padding around to give visual separation from other elements around it. Tables have a design feature with collapsed borders and alternate
                         background colors, making it easier to read. The structured layout makes the webpage clearer and more usable by users because it ensures they can access 
                         or move around content easily.
