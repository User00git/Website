                <p>
                    Welcome to my first website! My name is EJ and I am an ambitious undergraduate student who, just like you, also happens to attend the 
                    <i>University of Technology Sydney <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">(UTS)</a></i>. Similarly, we both probably hate icebreakers, however, on a website it is much easier I have to say. 
                    I have chosen to pursue my interests of cybersecurity as my major, a field that captivates me in the way of staying ahead of criminals 
                    by protecting privacy and livelihoods, <b>basically like <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Batman-Arkham-Knight-Gotham-City.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1">Batman</a></b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I do have experiences in graphic designing so I hope you see the vision I have for this website! I tried to
                    create something unique compared to other websites that you will see marking this, whilst maintaining a minimalistic style.
                    (if you believe the text is too small to read remember to use ctrl+/- to resize, so please be nice :3.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    I encourage you to explore my website, where I share insights into my past projects and outline my future aspirations in the computing field. 
                    This website serves as a canvas for my life so far... 
                </p>

                <p> Please feel free to navigate my website. <3 </p>
